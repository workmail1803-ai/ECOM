 * Site theme shape, defaults and validation.
 *
 * Deliberately free of any server import. The admin design form is a Client
 * Component and needs COLOR_FIELDS and FONT_CHOICES to render; when these

 * the client bundle and the build failed. Reading the stored theme lives in
 * lib/queries/theme.ts, which is server-only.
 *
 * Site theme, controlled from /admin/design.
 *
 * The whole design system is already CSS custom properties in globals.css, so
 * "give the admin control of the look" needs no new table and no rebuild: the
 * stored values are emitted as a `:root` override in the document head and the
 * cascade does the rest. Every component keeps using `text-ink` or
 * `bg-brand-600` and picks up the change for free.
 *
 * Fonts are a CHOICE from a fixed list rather than free text. next/font
 * subsets and self-hosts at build time, which is what keeps them off the
 * critical path — a font named at runtime could not be subset, would cost a
 * blocking request to a third party, and would flash. The list below is the
 * set that is actually compiled in.
