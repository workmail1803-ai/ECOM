Generate the Nazmul Commerce ADMIN manual QA test plan as a PDF.

Every case is something an operator actually does to run the shop, in the order
they would do it: set the store up, stock it, price it, take an order, get paid,
and look at the numbers afterwards.

Landscape A4 so steps and expected results sit side by side. Built-in Helvetica
is WinAnsi-encoded and has no glyph for the Taka sign, so money is written "Tk"
throughout -- a raw sign renders as a black box.
