/**
 * The hero: a row of tall campaign cards the shopper scrolls by hand.
 *
 * The card is a fixed 9:16 portrait at every breakpoint — that ratio is the
 * whole look, so it does not change between phone and desktop. Only how many
 * fit on screen changes: exactly two on a phone, four or five on a monitor.
 *
 * On a phone the two cards fill the row exactly, with no sliver of a third.
 * From `sm:` up the widths go back to leaving the next card partly visible,
 * which is the affordance that tells a mouse user the row scrolls at all.
 *
 * Content comes from `banners` — artwork, Bangla headline, caption, link and
 * accent colour are all editable at /admin/banners with no deploy. Two cards is
 * the practical minimum for the layout to read as a set; the seed ships seven.
